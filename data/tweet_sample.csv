Conversely, $GME +40.22, $EWZ +25.97, $WEAT +20.97 

Based on your forward vol forecast these names provide the best r/r currently."
"@KobeissiLetter Inflation drives 2, 3, and 4. Wages lagged behind prices, hence the labor shortage. This also points to weak consumer demand. Over 10 years of profitable ""buy the dips"" makes investors complacent, hence the subdued Vix."
Watch the VIX and watch the Dixie both need to be going down in order to have a successful push-up in the overall Market
